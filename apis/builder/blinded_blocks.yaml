  summary: Submit a signed blinded block and get unblinded execution payload and blobs sidecar.
  description: |
    Submits a `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` to the builder, binding the proposer
    to the block. The builder is now able to unblind the transactions in
    `ExecutionPayloadHeader` without the possibility of the validator modifying
    them.

    If the builder is not able to unblind the corresponding
    `ExecutionPayloadHeader`, it must error.
