  description: |
    Submits a `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` to the builder, binding the proposer
    to the block.

    A success response (200) indicates that the signed blinded beacon block was
    valid. If the signed blinded beacon block was invalid, then the builder
    must return an error response (400) with a description of the validation
    failure.
