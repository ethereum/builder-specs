  summary: Submit a signed blinded block and get unblinded execution payload.
  description: |
    Submits a `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` to the builder, binding the proposer
    to the block.

    A success response (200) indicates that the signed blinded beacon block was
    valid. If the signed blinded beacon block was invalid, then the builder
    must return an error response (400) with a description of the validation
    failure.

    After Deneb, this endpoint will additionally return the associated blobs in the response.

    Note: SSZ support can be determined by requesting an SSZ encoded response in the `getHeader`
    request.
