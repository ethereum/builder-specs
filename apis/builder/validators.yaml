  summary: Register or update a validator's block building preferences.
  description: |
    Registers a validator's preferred fee recipient and gas limit.

    A success response (200) indicates that the registration was valid. If the
    registration passes validation, then the builder MUST integrate the
    registration into its state, such that future blocks built for the
    validator conform to the preferences expressed in the registration. If the
    registration is invalid, then the builder MUST return an error response
    (400) with a description of the validation failure.
