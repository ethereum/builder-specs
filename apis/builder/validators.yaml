    Registers a validator's preferred fee recipient and gas limit.

    Builders should verify that `pubkey` corresponds to an active or pending
    validator, and that `signature` is valid under `pubkey`. Otherwise, builder
    must error. Requests with `timestamp` less than or equal to the previous
    announcement must error. Requests with `timestamp` greater than 10 seconds
    +/- the builder's local time must error.
