  summary: Register or update a validator's block building preferences.

    Registers a validator's preferred fee recipient and gas limit.

    Builders should verify that `pubkey` corresponds to an active or pending
    validator, and that `signature` is valid under `pubkey`. Otherwise, builder
    must error. Requests with `timestamp` less than or equal to the previous
    successful announcement must error. Requests with `timestamp` more than 10
    seconds in the future must error.
