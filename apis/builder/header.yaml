  operationId: "getHeader"
  summary: Get an execution payload header.
  description: |
    Requests a builder node to produce a valid execution payload header, which
    can be integrated into a blinded beacon block and signed.

    Builder must immediately return the header that is able to pay the
    proposer's registered `fee_recipient` the most. If the builder is unaware
    of `parent_hash`, it must error. If `pubkey` does not match the builder's
    expected proposer `pubkey` for `slot`, it must error. If the builder has
    not received a validator registration associated with `pubkey`, it must
    error.

    When possible, the builder must return a header with `gas_limit` equal to
    proposer's registered value. If this isn't possible due to the large
    difference between `parent.gas_limit` and the preferred `gas_limit`, the
    builder must return a header that moves `gas_limit` the maximum amount
    allowed under the rules of consensus (currently `parent.gas_limit +/-
    parent.gas_limit / 1024`).
