  summary: Get an `ExecutionPayloadHeader`.
  description: |
    Requests a builder node to produce a valid execution payload header, which
    can integrated into a blinded beacon block and signed.

    Builder must immediately return the header that is able to pay
    `feeRecipient` the most. If the builder is unaware of `parent_hash`, it
    must error. If `pubkey` does not match the builder's expected proposer
    `pubkey` for `slot`, it must error. If the builder has not received a
    validator registration associated with `pubkey`, it must error.

    When possibe, the builder must return a header with `gas_limit` equal to
    proposer's registered value. If this isn't possible due to the large
    difference between `parent.gas_limit` and the preferred `gas_limit`, the
    builder must return a header that moves `gas_limit` the maximum amount
    allowed under the rules of consensus (currently `parent.gas_limit +/-
    parent.gas_limit / 1024`).
