  summary: Get an execution payload header.
  description: |
    Requests a builder node to produce a valid execution payload header, which
    can be integrated into a blinded beacon block and signed.

    If the builder is unable to produce a valid execution payload header, then
    the builder MUST return a 204 response. If the request is invalid, then the
    builder MUST return an error response (400) with a description of the
    validation failure.

    After Deneb, return the KZG commitments for any associated blobs attached to the execution payload.

        latency.

        Optional header containing the proposer's timeout for the request in milliseconds. 
        Relays should use this header to adjust the amount of time by which they delay getHeader 
        requests to maximise block rewards. Otherwise, getHeader requests will timeout and the proposer 
        will not receive the header in time.
