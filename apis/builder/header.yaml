  summary: Get an execution payload header.
  description: |
    Requests a builder node to produce a valid execution payload header, which
    can be integrated into a blinded beacon block and signed.

    If the builder is unable to produce a valid execution payload header, then
    the builder MUST return a 204 response. If the request is invalid, then the
    builder MUST return an error response (400) with a description of the
    validation failure.

    After Deneb, return the KZG commitments for any associated blobs attached to the execution payload.

    After Fulu, this endpoint will not support JSON requests and responses. Client will have to send an SSZ encoded request and receive an SSZ encoded response.
