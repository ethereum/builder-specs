  summary: Submit a signed blinded beacon block, the builder publishes the signed unblinded beacon block and blobs to the network.
  description: |
    Submits a `SignedBlindedBeaconBlock` to the builder, binding the proposer
    to the block.

    A success response (200) indicates that the signed blinded beacon block was
    valid and published to the network. If the signed blinded beacon block was invalid, then the builder
    must return an error response (400) with a description of the validation
    failure.

    The builder MUST publish the signed unblinded beacon block and blobs to the network. 

    Note: SSZ support can be determined by requesting an SSZ encoded response in the `getHeader`
    request.
